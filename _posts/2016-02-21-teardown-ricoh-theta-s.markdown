Ricoh Theta S is a camera with two lenses that allows you to capture spherical images and videos. It's very slim and easy to use, but accidents can happen. We dropped ours by mistake, which gave us a reason to take a look at what's inside!

On the bottom of the Theta, there is a small glued piece under which you can find four screws.

The Theta is surrounded on the sides by a thin metal strip.

After taking out the metal strip, you can start to see the insides of the Theta.

After taking one of the caps off, you can see the battery pack and the connections for the lenses.

The two lenses are sitting on opposite sides.
